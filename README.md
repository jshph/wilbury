Project currently in development and many parts are not functional.

Current features:
- Web Audio API provides precise timing to play sounds. Made custom player by animating HTML elements, allowing for flexibility in positioning the sounds graphically.
- Since Web Audio API is not built for easy scheduling/cancellation of sounds, I used WAAclock as a wrapper to bypass one challenge.
